### Strings

A string is traditionally a sequence of characters. Strings are one of the common data types in all programming languages and python is not an exception.

String in Python is handled with `str` object and strings are immutable sequences.

---
### Strings in Python
Strings can be represented in various of ways:

```python
# Using Single Quotes
my_string1 = 'This is a string'

# Using Double Quotes
my_string2 = "This is a string too".

# Using Triple Quotes (Multiline strings)
my_string3 = '''Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. '''

# You could write it with double quotes as well
my_string3 = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. """
```
