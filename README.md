# Learn Python, Django & Web Development

This is a course targeted for beginners who are familiar with Programming Fundamentals (at least academically) and the contents are well suited especially for Fresh Computing students with no prior professional development experience.

This course mainly focuses on [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and slightly touches the basics of Web Development, Databases & Version Control System which are platform agnostic and are preliminaries to be covered in Web Development in any platform.

**This is a work in progress, I'm still writing up regularly for the topics listed below. So, stay tuned.**
